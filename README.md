# Machine Learning and Large-Scale Data Analysis (UChicago CMSC 35025)

- **HW1**: K-means clustering, text analysis, regression
- **HW2**: Textual analysis (using TF-IDF weights), comparison between K-means and spectral clustering
- **HW3**: PCA, K-means, dimension reduction, Bernoulli mixtures on  neural data and handwritten digits
- **HW4**: Bernoulli mixture model, logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent.
- **HW5**: Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using PyTorch on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, hyperparameter tuning, and performance analysis. (Basic architecture provided by the instructor.)
- **HW6**: Exploration and implementation of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory networks) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), and a comparison between logistic regression and RNN. (Basic architecture provided by the instructor.)

# Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning (Stanford CS 224N)

- **HW1**: Word embedding (Word2Vec, GloVe) vs. co-occurrence matrix comparison, cosine similarity, bias addressing, dimensionality reduction

# C Practice

- This folder contains exercises sourced from the book "C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. My long-term goal is to delve into the workings of operating systems. Understanding C is a significant step towards this, as it's used in OS development for its performance and control over hardware.
